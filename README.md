# idle_sync
Synchronize screen saver state between PCs!  If one PC is active, no PC will display a screensaver.  If no PC is active, all PCs will display a screensaver.

This project is in the Experiment phase.  There is no UI or polish, just a barely-implemented idea, although it does work.  (Yes, I let the IDE create the project for me..)
